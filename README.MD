# Circle CI Request Proxy for Latest Artifact

A simple HTTP Proxy that takes an incoming request, then find the latest build on CircleCI, 
then proxies that request back

## Why?

Lets say you want to show the latest documents generated by a build and 
you want to keep your cool domain name of course :boom:

CircleCI makes it a bit difficult because there's no `latest` tag you can use in their API

So instead we do the following chain of events

1. Request comes in to `myawesome.domain.com`

2. You send a request to `CircleCI` to find the latest build number

3. Using that build number you then find the artifacts associated with that build number

4. You filter out which file you're looking for and find the corresponding absolute URL 

5. Finally, you proxy **that** URL path back to the requester

Does a bunch of complicated calls when requests comes in, but looks like my cool domain 
from the outside :neckbeard:
