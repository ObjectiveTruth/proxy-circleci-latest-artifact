# Circle CI Request Proxy for Latest Artifact

A simple HTTP Proxy that takes an incoming request, then find the latest build on CircleCI, 
then proxies that request back

## Why?

Lets say you want to show the latest documents generated by a build and 
you want to keep your cool domain name of course :boom:

CircleCI makes it a bit difficult because there's no `latest` tag you can use in their API

So instead we do the following chain of events

1. Request comes in to `myawesome.domain.com`

2. You send a request to `CircleCI` to find the latest build number

3. Using that build number you then proxy the artifacts associated with that build number

4. You filter out which file you're looking for and find the corresponding full URL 

5. You proxy *that* URL back path to the requester
